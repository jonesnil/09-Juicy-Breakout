This is my improved breakout game. Hit the yellow tiles for 40 points, the purple for 30, the red for 20 and the blue for 10.
I was planning on making the game reset and go a little faster but I underestimated how much time the other features would take.
I added some tweening to the paddle and the tiles- the paddle goes to the mouse fast but slows down as it approaches it, and the 
tiles drop onto the screen and slow down to reach their spots. I didn't end up using the tweening node, the math was fairly simple.
I also made the tiles spawn randomly so the colors would be distributed differently each time. I spent a while trying to make it look
like chunks fell off when the ball hit something using particle effects but was mostly unsuccessful, though I did leave them in because
it works on occasion.

I added some public domain assets, like the background picture and the font. I also added a sound effect that plays when the ball hits 
something, and a cool song for the background. The sprites are from me.
